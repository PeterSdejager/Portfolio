## Firefox

* General
  * Uncheck **Restore previous session**
    * If you use a VPN and your connection dies, then when you use Firefox again, it will not spawn the same website, which would give away your data to the website
  * In **Network Settings**, enable **DNS over HTTPS** and choose **Cloudflare**
  * In **Browsing**, uncheck **Recommend extensions as you browse** and **Recommend features as you browse**
* Home
  * Set **Homepage and new windows** to **Blank Page**
  * Set **New tabs** to **Blank Page**
    * These will prevent Firefox from spawning their own sites when you need a new page/tab
  * Uncheck everything under **Firefox Home Content** (Shortcuts, Recommended by Pocket, Recent activity, Snippets)
    * This will prevent Firefox from loading their own content
* Search
  * Change **Default Search Engine** to **DuckDuckGo**
  * Uncheck **Provide Suggestions**
    * Prevents the queries from going to the Google API
* Privacy & Security
  * Under **Cookies and Site Data**, check **Delete cookies and site data when Firefox is closed**
  * Under **Logins and Passwords**, uncheck the boxes (with the inside list first):
    * **Show alerts about passwords for breached websites**
    * **Suggest and generate strong passwords**
    * **Autofill logins and passwords**
    * and then, **Ask to save logins and passwords for websites**
  * Under **History,** in the dropdown choose Firefox will **Use custom settings for history**.
    * Also uncheck, **Remember search and form history**, and **Remember browsing and download history**
    * Check **Clear history when Firefox closes**
    * **DO NOT** check the box next to **Always use private browsing mode**
      * It will break Firefox containers
  * Under **Address Bar,** only have **Bookmarks** and **Open tabs** showing up
    * Also uncheck **Suggestions from the web** and **Suggestions from sponsors**
  * Under **Permissions**, click **Settings**... next to **Location, Camera, Microphone,** and **Notifications**. In the popup, check the **"Block new requests.."** box on the bottom.
  * Under **Firefox Data Collection and Use**, uncheck everything
  * Under **Security**, uncheck everything
  * Under **HTTPS-Only Mode**, best practice would be to use **Enable HTTPS-Only Mode in all windows**. However, I use **Enable HTTPS-Only in private windows only**

These are the settings I use when you type in **about:config** in the search bar:

  * I use 1 just to be safe

  * Disables any embedded Firefox accounts

## Gnome Tweaks

Gnome extensions can be found [here](https://extensions.gnome.org/). I got a couple of recommendations from [Pop!\_OS](https://support.system76.com/articles/customize-gnome).

* Window List - [https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/602/window-list/](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/602/window-list/)
* Sound Output Device Chooser - [https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/906/sound-output-device-chooser/](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/906/sound-output-device-chooser/)
* User Themes - [https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/19/user-themes/](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/19/user-themes/)

I learned that you can also apply themes to Linux. In order to do this, I went to [this site](https://www.gnome-look.org/s/Gnome/browse/), and then did the following:

* Download and extract the .tar.xz file.
* Install [User Themes](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/19/user-themes) extension
* Move the theme folder to ".themes" in your home directory. (Some themes have more than one folder, so youll have to read the instructions)

In order to change the theme you will have to install gnome-tweaks by running `sudo apt install gnome-tweaks`. To change the theme (in the Tweaks app), go to **Appearance**, and then you can change the theme from **Shell**.

I used the following theme(s):

* Flat Remix GNOME - [https://www.gnome-look.org/p/1013030](https://www.gnome-look.org/p/1013030)

## Post Set Up Checklist

* [ ] Set up theme for desktop and icons
  * [ ] Flat-Remix-Blue-Dark
  * [ ] [https://github.com/EliverLara/candy-icons](https://github.com/EliverLara/candy-icons)
* [ ] Ohmyzsh (Zsh) OR starship (Bash)
* [ ] Change colors in terminal (if needed) and use transparent background about 10% on the slide bar
