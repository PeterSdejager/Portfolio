## Ingredients

* [ ] 2 cups vegetable broth
* [ ] 3 pounds boneless short rib
* [ ] 1 medium/large yellow onion
* [ ] 6 cloves garlic, minced
* [ ] 3 tablespoons apple cider vinegar
* [ ] 1 tablespoon oregano
* [ ] 1 teaspoon cumin
* [ ] 2 teaspoons coriander
* [ ] 7 oz. Chipotle Peppers in Adobo Sauce
* [ ] Salt & Pepper
* [ ] 15 oz. can diced fire roasted tomatoes
* [ ] Corn Tortillas
* [ ] 1 medium red onion diced

## Recipe

1. Preheat oven to 350
2. Cut the beef into 3 in. x 3 in. cubes and rub neutral oil (vegetable / canola) on them
3. Season the beef well with salt & pepper and sear in 2 batches in a hot oven proof pot - remove the seared meat (should be golden/brown on all sides) to a plate and repeat with remaining beef
4. To the empty pot, add the onions with a little more neutral oil and cook until softened, about 5 minutes
5. Add the vinegar, scraping up the bits on the bottom and allow about 1/2 of the vinegar to evaporate - then add garlic and when fragrant, about 45 seconds later add the beef back in and take off the heat
6. In a blender combine the vegetable broth, oregano, cumin, coriander, chopotle peppers in adobo sauce, fire-roasted tomatoes and salt\&pepper.
7. Blend until very smooth and pour over beef in pot - the beef should be covered and if not add a little more broth
8. Cover, and place in the oven until fork tender and shred-able - approx 3-4 hours
9. For serving, warm a tortilla on a pan. Place beef, then a bit of red onion and cilantro.
10. (OPTIONAL) You can make a mix of diced white/red onion, cilantro, and lime/lemon juice for easy access when serving
