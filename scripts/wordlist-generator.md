# Wordlist Generator

This script creates word-lists based on a word you give it, and the selections you make. It is meant to be a simpler **crunch**, in a way. Simply stated, you choose a word ("test"), choose the amount of extra characters you want (3), and finally choose the character list you want (4 = special characters). This leads you to a 7 character list, with the first 4 letters being **test** and the other three characters being iterated through by the code. This code is meant to creating custom word-lists for cracking Wi-Fi passwords (based on a bit of knowledge) , or passwords in general.
