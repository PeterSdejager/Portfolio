Vulnerability:

There is a vulnerability in the lock, where you are able to bypass picking on all the pins if you are able to access the locking mechanism (latch?) in the back. The easiest way to explain it would be to push the locking mechanism up and then down, which will unlock the lock. This is located at the end of the plug. This lock is also rake-able.
