# Blueprint

This is a write-up for the machine on TryHackMe located at: [https://tryhackme.com/room/blueprint](https://tryhackme.com/room/blueprint).

The first thing I did was run an nmap scan:

```c
sudo nmap -Pn -T4 -A -sS -p- 10.10.21.26 -oN output
```

This was my results from the scan:

```c

The first thing I did was go to the websites on port 80 and 443 to see what is going on there. I got the following result:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (117) (1).png>)

This seemed to be some sort of selling website so I was not sure if this is what I am looking for. Port 443 and 8080 lead me to the same result:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (118) (1).png>)

I then ran **gobuster** on the "oscommerce" url and got the following result:

I was looking around the directories and did not find anything significant. A lot of the directories showed me the following page:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (119) (1).png>)

I then viewed this [write-up](https://www.cybersecpadawan.com/2020/05/tryhackme-blueprint-exploitation-no.html), and realized that my search was missing the "Install" directory. I then ran a search using [feroxbuster,](https://github.com/epi052/feroxbuster) and I got the result so much quicker:

```

Here, I then saw the "Install" directory. This page was still the same as before:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (120) (1).png>)

I then saw the same [write-up](https://www.cybersecpadawan.com/2020/05/tryhackme-blueprint-exploitation-no.html), and noticed that they used **searchsploit** in order to search for a vulnerability for the machine. I then got this result:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (121) (1).png>)

I wanted to try out the **Arbitrary File Upload** first. To get this in my current directory, I ran the following commands:

```c
searchsploit -p php/webapps/43191.py #Shows the full path for the code
cp /usr/share/exploitdb/exploits/php/webapps/43191.py . #copies it to the local directory
```

I ran the code just by itself to see what parameters it was looking for:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (122) (1).png>)

I noticed that I needed a target (at least), authentication, and file. I tried to enter in just the target argument. I then realized I did not have the username and password for the authentication. I then went back to the install page in the catalog directory:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (123) (1).png>)

I then clicked on the **start** button to see what it did. I entered root for the username and the Database Name and then press continue:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (124) (1).png>)

I tried **admin** for the Username, and I ran into an error. I then tried **root** and it worked! I then set the Online Store Settings like:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (125) (1).png>)

All the previous setup for the commerce site was based off of [the same write-up](https://www.cybersecpadawan.com/2020/05/tryhackme-blueprint-exploitation-no.html). I then got the following page:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (126) (1).png>)

I was then lost about where to go from here. I then looked at the write-up and learned that I had to upload a basic PHP file:

```php
<?php passthru($_GET['cmd']);
?>
```

I then ran the python file with the modules:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (127) (1).png>)

I then realized I had made a mistake. In my python command, I had added a "/" in the URL when I was not supposed to do so. After that, I was successful:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (128) (1).png>)

I will be honest, at this part, I had to look back at the write-up because I was out of the TryHackMe game for a while, and was not sure what to do. The next item I had to do was get a reverse shell on the machine. In order to do this, I would have to use **msfvenom** in order to do so:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (129) (1).png>)

Now I can run a **netcat** listener and then go to the webpage with the executable on it:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (130) (1).png>)

I then ran systeminfo in order to gain information about the system. I then got the following result:

```

I then had to upload mimikatz to the Windows machine. I had to first find the location of mikikatz on the machine:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (131) (1).png>)

I was looking for the **mimikatz.exe** file. I then had to upload the file to the machine:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (132) (1).png>)

I was then able to access **mimikatz** on the machine:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (133) (1).png>)

I got the following output when I ran **lsadump::sam**:

```php

```

Using [crackstation](https://crackstation.net/), I was able to crack one of the two hashes:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (134) (1).png>)

This was the answer to one of the questions on the machine. The second answer was the root.txt file "password". I got to this through changing directory by "cd-ing" into the directory and then running the following command:

```php
C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop>type root.txt.txt
```

I then solved the room!
