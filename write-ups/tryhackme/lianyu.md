# Lian\_Yu

## This is a room on the TryHackMe website at: [https://tryhackme.com/room/lianyu](https://tryhackme.com/room/lianyu)

I started off by doing an nmap scan:

```text
nmap -T4 -A -oN nmaptxt 10.10.121.53
```

I then got the following output:

```text

I see 4 ports open. My first idea is to open the main page.

Here, the word "arrow" was bolded, so I saved it, just in case it could mean something later on. I then ran a gobuster command, in order to enumerate the directories on the server. I ran the following command:

```text
gobuster dir -u http://10.10.121.53/ -w ../resources/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-small.txt -t 40
```

In the previous command, the wordlist I am using comes from [this github page](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists). I then found a directory called: "is----".

I then ran gobuster again with the addition of the new directory I had found:

```text
gobuster dir -u http://10.10.121.53/is----/ -w ../resources/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-small.txt -t 40
```

![](../../.gitbook/assets/inkedpasted-image-20210318224731_li%20%281%29.jpg)

I then found another directory called "2---". Looking at the source of this website, I found this:

![](../../.gitbook/assets/inkedpasted-image-20210317202453_li.jpg)

It is then shown that we need to find a file that has an extension with ".ticket". I then ran gobuster once more, but this time, I ran with an extension:

```text
gobuster dir -u http://10.10.121.53/is----/2---/ -w ../resources/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-small.txt -t 40 -x .ticket
```

I then found a file with a .ticket extension.

What I had crossed out in red was a password of some sort. I then had to look at the clue on the TryHackMe Lian\_Yu room. This led me to realize that the part crossed out in red was actually the ftp password in a base encoding.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/pasted-image-20210317203002.png)

I then went to CyberChef, and was able to crack the password:

![](../../.gitbook/assets/pasted-image-20210317203341.png)

This gave me the ftp password. I then had to find the username. At this point, I did get stuck, and consulted [this write-up](https://infosecwriteups.com/tryhackme-lian-yu-ctf-writeup-detailed-7c229b1904fd) to find out what I missed. I realized that I had overlooked a word on a website. On the IP/is----/ website, I overlooked a word:

![](../../.gitbook/assets/inkedpasted-image-20210318224731_li%20%283%29.jpg)

This word was in white, and I was unable to see it initially since it matched the background. I then used "vigilante" as the username, and then used the password for the ftp I got earlier. I then got into ftp:

Here I can see 4 files I need to get: The 2 PNGs, the one JPG, and the last file was the ".other user" file. I downloaded all of them using "mget \*". This should download all the files to your local directory. Reading the ".other user", I came across this:

![](../../.gitbook/assets/pasted-image-20210318230027.png)

Here I can see various names, which could be potential usernames and/or passwords. One main name was "Slade" was what stuck out to me. I got stuck here once again. I then looked at the [previous write-up](https://infosecwriteups.com/tryhackme-lian-yu-ctf-writeup-detailed-7c229b1904fd), in order to realize that I had to run "steghide" on the aa.jpg file. When you run steghide, we need a password to extract the data from the aa.jpg file. This is where the Leave-me-alone.png file comes into play. The header for this file is messed up, so we have to edit the header. I found the header online on Wikipedia:

![](../../.gitbook/assets/pasted-image-20210318225339.png)

I then edited the header of the file using the "hexeditor":

![](../../.gitbook/assets/pasted-image-20210318224939.png)

I was then able to view the file:

![](../../.gitbook/assets/pasted-image-20210318225254.png)

This turned out to be the password for the "steghide" command. Running the following command:

![](../../.gitbook/assets/pasted-image-20210318230316.png)

Entering the password from the "Leave-me-alone.jpg", I then got the output file:

![](../../.gitbook/assets/pasted-image-20210318230337.png)

I then found the password for the ssh server for the user "slade". I then entered those credentials and then I got into the server:

![](../../.gitbook/assets/pasted-image-20210318230445.png)

Here my first idea was to run "ls" to find out files in my current directory. I then saw the flag in a "user.txt" file. I then had to upgrade my privileges to root. To do this I ran "sudo -l". This command lets you know what commands our user can do as the root user.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/pasted-image-20210318230518.png)

Here it can be seen that the command I can run as root is "pkexec". I then went to [https://gtfobins.github.io/](https://gtfobins.github.io/) in order to find out how I can use this command to get to root. I then found this webpage:

![](../../.gitbook/assets/pasted-image-20210318230928.png)

Running this command, I got to root

![](../../.gitbook/assets/pasted-image-20210318231035.png)

Reading the root.txt file, I saw the last flag and was able to complete the box!
