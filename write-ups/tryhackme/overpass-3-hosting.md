# Overpass 3 - Hosting

This is my write-up for the TryHackMe machine at: [https://tryhackme.com/room/overpass3hosting](https://tryhackme.com/room/overpass3hosting)

Nmap Scan command:

```
nmap -T4 -A 10.10.168.65 -oN nmapscan
```

Nmap output:

I noticed that they have 3 ports open. I went to the web (port 80) first to check it out:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (625).png>)

There was no `/robots.txt` file. I then ran **gobuster** on the IP address:

```
gobuster dir --url http://10.10.168.65/  -w directory-list-lowercase-2.3-big.txt -t 40
```

About 4% of the gobuster search, I got the following output:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (485) (1).png>)

Going to the backups website, I saw this:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (666) (1) (1).png>)

I then downloaded the file. There were two files in the zip file:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (519).png>)

Using [this write-up](https://musyokaian.medium.com/overpass-3-hosting-tryhackme-walkthrough-d77703a72495), I realized that I can decrupt the file with the private key I have:

```
gpg --import priv.key //import the key
gpg --decrypt CustomerDetails.xlsx.gpg > CustomerDetails.xlsx //output to new file
```

Since I am on Linux (Kali), I wanted to convert the file to a version that I would be able to view in. I ran the following command to convert the Excel file into a csv file, which I was able to read:

```
ssconvert CustomerDetails.xlsx newfile.csv
```

I was then able to see the contents of the file:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (548).png>)

It seems to be the customers of the website, based on the context. We also have their username and password. I will try this in FTP, and my plan is that if the password does not work on FTP, then I will try SSH. In FTP, I got access using the credentials for "Par. A. Doxx":

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (644).png>)

FTP seemed to only work for that user. The other passwords did not work in FTP. When I tried for SSH, the credentials did not work there either. I then went back to the same write-up above and then realized that I had to upload a php-reverse-shell. Going to [this GitHub page](https://github.com/pentestmonkey/php-reverse-shell/blob/master/php-reverse-shell.php), I downloaded the reverse-shell script. In the script, I changed the IP address to my TryHackMe IP address. I then uploaded the file to the server:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (432).png>)

I then ran `nc -lvp 1234` on another terminal tab, and was listening for a connection. After visiting **http://10.10.168.65/php-reverse-shell.php**, I got a reverse shell:

After being stuck for a while, I viewed [this write-up](https://www.aldeid.com/wiki/TryHackMe-Overpass-3-Hosting) in order to see where to go next. I used the command the author of the write-up used:

```
find / -type f -name "*flag*" -exec ls -l {} + 2>/dev/null
```

This gave me the following output:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (363).png>)

This file had the flag in it:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (456).png>)

I then downloaded Linpeas to my local machine using **wget**. I then pushed that to the server using an http server:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (542).png>)

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (669).png>)

I then ran linpeas on the remote machine. I then saw the following, when I also saw in other write-ups as well:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (441).png>)

I then went back to the most recently mentioned write-up, in order to understand what I had to do next. Following [this write-up](https://shishirsubedi.com.np/thm/overpass3/), I uploaded my key to the remote server so I can connect in an easier method. Here are the commands I ran:

```
My machine: ssh-keygen -f paradox
My machine: cat paradox.pub
//Take the information inside the paradox.pub and copy it to the remote machine
Remote machine: echo "ssh-rsa ............" > .ssh/paradox
```

I was then able to ssh into the machine to the user paradox from my machine directly:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (367).png>)

After a long time of being stuck, I finally found a solution reading [this write-up](https://cryptichacker.github.io/posts/overpass3hosting/). My mistake was running the wrong command. The following is what worked for me:

```
ssh -i paradox -L 20049:127.0.0.1:2049  paradox@10.10.168.65
```

I changed 2049 before the IP to 20049, since I kept on getting errors that the port was already in use. I then ran the following command to mount the share to my local machine:

```
sudo mount -t nfs -o port=20049 localhost: nfs
```

If we change directory into the **nfs** folder, we can see the file system mounted there:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (613).png>)

I read the user flag. After that, the ssh authorized key I had uploaded to paradox earlier, I had not uploaded it to **.ssh/authorized\_keys** in the mounted directory. I then was able to SSH to the machine:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (507).png>)

I read up from [this write-up](https://cryptichacker.github.io/posts/overpass3hosting/) that I can now use the **no\_root\_squash** exploit, something that linpeas.sh had shown us earlier. I followed the following commands from the write-up to get it to work:

```
#In the mounted dir, as root user
cp /bin/bash ./
chmod +s bash

#In the remote machine as user james
./bash -p
```

This got me root user on the machine. I then got the root flag.
