# Game Zone

This is my write-up for the TryHackMe machine at: [https://tryhackme.com/room/gamezone](https://tryhackme.com/room/gamezone).

### Deploy the vulnerable machine

The hint for the first question is **Reverse Image Search**. I then posted the picture in `Yandex.com` and got the following:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (275).png>)

I then clicked on an image and it led me to a title: **Hitman Absolution**. I then Google-d the character name, and got the answer:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (276).png>)

> What is the name of the large cartoon avatar holding a sniper on the forum? Agent 47

### Obtain access via SQLi

I then ran an **nmap** scan:

```c
nmap -T4 -A 10.10.72.202 -oN nmap_scan.txt
```

I got the following output:

```c

```

I noticed that there were only 2 ports open: 22 and 80. I went on port 80 to see what the website is:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (277).png>)

After entering in **' or 1=1 -- -** in the username portion and left the password field empty (based on the recommendations of the THM room creator). I was in then:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (278).png>)

> When you've logged in, what page do you get redirected to? **portal.php**

### **Using SQLMap**

For this one, we have to intercept the request to get the format for the SQLMap usage later. I turned on **Burpsuite**, and then got the request:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (279).png>)

I then saved this to a file:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (280).png>)

I then ran the command the room recommended:

```c
sqlmap -r sqlmap_output.txt --dbms=mysql --dump
```

I then got the following output:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (281).png>)

> In the users table, what is the hashed password? **ab**\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*
>
> What was the username associated with the hashed password? **agent47**
>
> What was the other table name? **post**

### Cracking a password with JohnTheRipper

For this one, I went with Hashcat, just because I am more comfortable with hashcat. I ran the following command:

```c
hashcat -m 1400 ab5db915fc9cea6c78df88106c6500c57f2b52901ca6c0c6218f04122c3efd14 rockyou.txt
```

The rockyou.txt file is default in Kali, and it is located at /usr/share/wordlist. I copied it to the local directory, ran **gunzip** on it, and got the file. As for the hashcat hash crack run, I got the following output:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (282).png>)

> What is the de-hashed password? **vi\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\***

I ran `ssh agent47@10.10.72.202` and used the password I had received before, and got into the machine:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (283).png>)

I then got the user.txt flag:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (284).png>)

> What is the user flag? **649\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\***

### **Exposing serviced with reverse SSH tunnels**

> How many TCP sockets are running? **5**

I then ran the following command, based on the recomendation from the machine:

```c
ssh -L 10000:localhost:10000 agent47@10.10.72.202
```

I then posted the password that I had gotten previously into the password for the SSH, and got in again:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (285).png>)

This time, we have the webapp running on our localhost:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (286).png>)

> What is the name of the exposed CMS? **Webmin**

The login credentials for the webapp were the same credentials from previously, this leads to this site:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (287).png>)

> What is the CMS version? **1.580**

### Privilege Escalation with Metasploit

I searched on msfconsole for an exploit:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (289).png>)

I then started filling in options, and ended up with this:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (288).png>)

I realized that the RHOST was supposed to be set to 127.0.0.1, based on [this writeup](https://www.aldeid.com/wiki/TryHackMe-Game-Zone#.5BTask\_6.5D\_Privilege\_Escalation\_with\_Metasploit). When I changed that option in msfconsole, I was then able to get the exploit to work. I then got the flag:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (292).png>)

> What is the root flag? **a4\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\***
