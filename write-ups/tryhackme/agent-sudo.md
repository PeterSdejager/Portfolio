# Agent Sudo

This is my write-up for the machine on TryHackMe located at: [https://tryhackme.com/room/agentsudoctf](https://tryhackme.com/room/agentsudoctf).

Port 80 was opened, so I checked it out:

I tried to use BurpSuite here to edit the User-Agent to be "Agent S", based off of my assumption that my codename was Agent S. This did not work. I then used **gobuster** alongside the **directory-list-2.3-small.txt** wordlist. I then was reading [this write-up](https://marcorei7.wordpress.com/2020/07/29/008-agent-sudo/) which led me to realize that I was not supposed to brute-force the website, but actually just change my user agent (I used **User-Agent Switcher and Manager** on Firefox):

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (457).png>)

We now know that user C is **chris** and his password is weak. I chose this time to answer the questions on THM:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (707).png>)

For the next task, it seemed that I needed to brute-force the password for FTP. Knowing that the username was **chris**, I then used hydra to try to brute-force the password: `hydra -l chris -P rockyou.txt ftp://10.10.126.175 -t 16`. I was able to get the password:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (431).png>)

After logging into the ftp server with the credentials, we see the following:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (684).png>)

I then used **mget \*** to download all of the files:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (387).png>)

![To\_agentJ.txt](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (655).png>)

![cutie.png](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (500).png>)

![cute-alien.jpg](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (709).png>)

It seems from the **To\_agentJ.txt** file that we have to find the password in one of the images provided. Running **strings** on the **cutie.png** file, I saw this towards the end:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (330).png>)

This led me to assume that this was the correct file to brute-force. I ran `binwalk -e cutie.png` and this led me to a directory with the following:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (665) (1).png>)

There is a password for the zip file. I used **fcrackzip** in order to try to brute-force the password. I was trying for a bit to understand what was going on, but I was unable to crack the password. This is when I went back to the [website where I read the write-up from previously](https://marcorei7.wordpress.com/2020/07/29/008-agent-sudo/) and found out about **zip2john**. This program gets you a hash from a zip file which you can use with John The Ripper. I then ran the following to output the hash into a location that worked for me: `zip2john ../../8702.zip > ../../../zip_hash`. I then ran john on the hash, and got the password in a couple seconds:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (583).png>)

After entering the password for the zip by running `7z e 8702.zip`, I then was able to get the file hidden in it:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (624).png>)

In order to crack the password for the other image, I used **StegSeek**:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (439).png>)

This led me to this text file:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (355).png>)

When I entered the password **hackerrules!** as the answer to the question _SSH password_, I got it correct. This means that this is the password for SSH. Logging in with those credentials, I was able to get into the system, and get the user flag:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (711) (1).png>)

There was another jpeg on the system as well. I used **FileZilla** in order to download the file to my local machine:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (690).png>)

![Alien\_autopsy.jpg](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (448).png>)

On THM there was a question asking _What is the incident of the photo called?_. In my research I came to the conclusion it had something to do with Roswell and Aliens. I had to go back to the write-up, in order to realize the answer was **roswell alien autopsy**. I am still at the user (james) level, and I need to escalate my privileges. I ran `sudo -l` to see what sudo commands my user had:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (527) (1).png>)

Seems that he can run /bin/bash with sudo permission. I Googled "exploit db (ALL, !root) /bin/bash" and found the following page: [https://web.archive.org/web/20210120002645/www.exploit-db.com/exploits/47502](https://web.archive.org/web/20210120002645/www.exploit-db.com/exploits/47502). This has an exploit in it for our system. I ran the exploit and got root:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (672) (1).png>)

I then also got the root flag:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (593).png>)
