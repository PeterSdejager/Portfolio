### Nmap Scan:

I ran **nmap -T4 -A 10.10.161.100 -oN nmap\_output**, however this did not get me anywhere. It seemed to me that the host was blocking ping probes. I then ran **nmap -Pn 10.10.161.100**:

```c
Host discovery disabled (-Pn). All addresses will be marked 'up' and scan times will be slower.
Starting Nmap 7.91 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2021-06-03 15:25 EDT

139/tcp  filtered netbios-ssn
3389/tcp filtered ms-wbt-server

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 120.16 seconds
```

I later ran **sudo nmap -p- -Pn -sS -A 10.10.161.100 -oN fullscan.txt** which got me way more information\*\*:\*\*

### Foothold:

I needed to find a way into the system, or a foothold. I browsed to the IP address:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (87).png>)

I wanted to see if SMB is being ran on this page, I then used metasploit to find out what version of SMB was running:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (88).png>)

I then ran a nmap script just for smb "**nmap --script smb-os-discovery 10.10.161.100**":

```c
Host script results:
| smb-os-discovery: 
|   OS: Windows Server 2016 Standard Evaluation 14393 (Windows Server 2016 Standard Evaluation 6.3)
|   Computer name: Relevant
|   NetBIOS computer name: RELEVANT\x00
|   Workgroup: WORKGROUP\x00
|_  System time: 2021-06-03T13:22:34-07:00
```

I believed that smb is my way in. I then ran **smbclient**:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (89).png>)

I then noticed a unique Sharename **nt4wrksv**. I wanted to see what's in here. So I ran smbclient to have access to the share:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (90).png>)

I then saw a **passwords.txt** file.

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (91).png>)

I then wanted to download it:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (92).png>)

I was able to then read the password file on my local system:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (93).png>)

The passwords were encoded, and it seemed to be base64 to me. Using [https://www.base64decode.org/](https://www.base64decode.org/) I was able to decode the text:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (96).png>)

To me, this seemed like a login for an smb user. Viewing [this writeup](https://medium.com/cybersecpadawan/relevant-walk-through-on-tryhackme-f7dedfcb00dc), I noticed that the decoded had made me miss another password. I then had 2 logins:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (97).png>)

I did not know what tool to use next to get further. I then used [the same write-up](https://medium.com/cybersecpadawan/relevant-walk-through-on-tryhackme-f7dedfcb00dc) and noticed that I would have to use **psexec** which is located in **/usr/share/doc/python3-impacket/examples**. I was then able to run it on the SMB:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (98).png>)

The user for Bill did not work:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (99).png>)

Now I wanted to move back and see another way inside. Both port 80 and 49663 both are running the same website:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (100).png>)

I then ran **dirsearch** on the port 49663:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (101).png>)

At this point we have access to a website which has the same contents as the smb server:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (102).png>)

### **Exploitation:**

In order to exploit this system, I will have to create a payload to then submit to the samba share. I will have to use msfvenom in order to create this. I uploaded a .exe and it did not work. I had to find another format to upload the file to. I then looked at the same aforementioned writeup to see what format they used. They used **.aspx**. I also did not know that Windows Server 2016 is a x64 architecture. With those in mind, I then made a payload:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (103) (1).png>)

I then had to upload this to the smb server:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (104).png>)

I then have to go to the web version on the payload so that way it can be initiated. Before I do that, I have to have a netcat listener open on another terminal. The payload worked:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (105).png>)

Browsing around the file system I found the user flag:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (106).png>)

This was my first Windows machine, so I had to refer to the write-up to know where to go next. I then learned that I would have to upload an exe called **PrintSpoofer** which impersonates privileges. I then downloaded it:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (107).png>)

I then had to upload it. I did this using the same method as I did for the payload:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (108).png>)

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (110).png>)

I then ran:

```c
PrintSpoofer.exe -i -c cmd
```

which led me to this:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (111) (1) (1).png>)

I then went to the Desktop of the Administrator and got the flag:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (112) (1) (1).png>)

### What I Learned:

I learned a lot from this machine. It was my first Windows machine so there was a little learning curve for me while attempting this machine. I learned about **whoami /priv** which was not something I had known about previously. Overall, a great Windows machine, however NOT recommended for Windows machine beginners.
