# RootMe

This is my write-up for the machine on TryHackMe called **RootMe**: [https://tryhackme.com/room/rrootme](https://tryhackme.com/room/rrootme)

I first ran an nmap scan on the IP address:

```c
sudo nmap -T4 -A 10.10.78.153
```

This is the output I got:

```c

My first step was to visit the website on port 80:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (184).png>)

There seems to be nothing on the website other that the following text. I then ran **feroxbuster** with the big.txt file from the Seclists Github repository:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (185).png>)

Two links stood out to me:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (186).png>)

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (187).png>)

My assumption was to upload the **pentestmonkey php-reverse-shell** and then get a webshell using that. I first updated the script to have my information in it (IP and port):

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (188).png>)

Apparently PHP is not permitted:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (189).png>)

I then though about using an alternative php version like phtml. That worked... a bit:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (190).png>)

However, I was not able to get a shell on the system. I then tried the original pentestmonkey script, but then I changed the extension to be **.phtml**, and it worked:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (191).png>)

At this point, I had realized that I had to answer questions on the TryHackMe site.

> Scan the machine, how many ports are open? **2**
>
> What version of Apache is running? **2.4.29**
>
> What service is running on port 22? **ssh**
>
> What is the hidden directory? **/panel/**

Back to the shell, I was trying to find the user.txt file. It was not in the home directory folders. I then ran:

```c
find / -name user.txt
```

I then saw the following in the big output:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (192).png>)

I then got the user.txt flag:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (193).png>)

I then had to view the hint provided to see what command I should run to check for files with SUID permission. They recommended **find / -user root -perm /4000**. I ran that command and noticed a couple commands I could potentially use:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (195).png>)

On TryHackMe, the format of the question seems to be in the following format:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (196).png>)

This means that the executable has to be 6 letters in size. I tried **/usr/bin/python** and it worked. I went to **GTFOBins** and searched on it for python. I then came across the following:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (197).png>)

I ran this code, but modified it to read the file from the root directory:

```c
python -c 'print(open("/root/root.txt").read())'
```

I then got the flag:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (198).png>)
