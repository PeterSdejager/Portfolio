# Anthem

This is my write-up for the TryHackMe box known as Anthem located at: [https://tryhackme.com/room/anthem](https://www.tryhackme.com/room/anthem).

## Website Analysis

The firs thing I did was ran nmap onto the IP address. I did this with the following command:

```c
sudo nmap -Pn -T4 -A -sS -p- <IP Address> -oN output
```

I then got the following as the result:

```c
Host discovery disabled (-Pn). All addresses will be marked 'up' and scan times will be slower.

> What port is for the web server? **80**
>
> What port is for remote desktop service? **3389**

From this point, I went to browsing the webpage to see if there is anything suspicious or standing out for me to use. After browsing around and not finding anything, I decided to run DirBuster on the website:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (113) (1) (1).png>)

Although I was getting a lot of information from the DirBuster search, it was the hint for the question which got me further:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (114) (1).png>)

My first thought after looking at this was **robots.txt**, and sure enough when I went to that webpage, I found this:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (115) (1).png>)

> What is a possible password in one of the pages web crawlers check for? **UmbracoIsTheBest!**
>
> What CMS is the website using? **Umbraco**

For the previous question, I took a look at [this writeup](https://apjone.uk/anthem-tryhackme-write-up/), which made me realize that **Umbraco** was a CMS all along. As for the next question, a quick glance at the main page can show you what the domain name is:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (116) (1).png>)

> What is the domain of the website? **Anthem.com**

I was having a hard time trying to find the admin of the website. I looked around all around the website looking though the JavaScript and HTML, and was not able to find anything. I then [viewed this write-up](https://swafox.com/anthem/) to see where I went wrong. I had to look more closely at the "poem" on one of the pages:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (136) (1).png>)

Instead of searching about this online, I realized that I might have heard this before in reference to Solomon Grundy (maybe in regards to Comics?). I tried it and it worked as the answer!

> What's the name of the Administrator? Solomon Grundy

Using the hint from TryHackMe, I realized that I had to find the naming scheme for the email. I then found this:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (137).png>)

> Can we find the email address of the administrator? SG@anthem.com

## Spot the flags

I had to use the hint for the first flag. The hint was "**Have we inspected the pages yet?**", and then I tried to go off of that, and got nowhere. I then viewed [the same write-up](https://swafox.com/anthem/) and noticed that the author used burpsuite. I realized that I will try to do the same. I then found the flag:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (140).png>)

For Flag 2, I just found it on source of the main page:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (138) (1).png>)

For Flag 3, I was looking around on different pages, and ended up finding it on the site: **\<IP\_adress>/authors/jane-doe**:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (139).png>)

For Flag 4, I then found it following the same steps as Flag 1:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (141).png>)

## Final Stage

We have to figure out the username and password for the box. My first thought was to make a name list based on the names I saw on the website. I looked at the other port, other than 80, and it was 3389. Port 3389 was used for RDP, also knowing as Remote Desktop Protocol. I then had to find a software to get access to the desktop of the machine. I find out about [**rdesktop**](http://www.rdesktop.org/), and used it. As for the username, I viewed [this write up](https://pencer.io/ctf/ctf-thm-anthem/#task-3---final-stage) and realized that the username would be **SG**. It took me a while to get the password, which was from the first section of the machine: **UmbracoIsTheBest!** I then used that information to log in using the command:

```c
rdesktop -u SG 10.10.152.51
```

After I entered the password, I then saw the following:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (142) (1).png>)

I opened the **user.txt** file, and got the following:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (143) (1).png>)

> Gain initial access to the machine, what is the contents of user.txt? **THM{N00T\_NO0T}**

After I was lost for a while trying to find an answer to the next question, I viewed [this write-up](https://pencer.io/ctf/ctf-thm-anthem/), and noticed that a folder was hidden in the **C:\\** drive. In order to view it, you had to change the settings to view the hidden folder:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (145) (1).png>)

I was then able to see the hidden folder:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (146) (1).png>)

I was unable to view the file, because I did not have permissions. I then changed the permissions to be for **SG**:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (147) (1).png>)

I was then able to view the file:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (148) (1).png>)

> Can we spot the admin password? **ChangeMeBaby1MoreTime**

I did not have any idea about how to get root on a Windows machine. I then viewed the same previous write-up and noticed that we have the admin password. So we can use PowerShell at an admin level. I then got into the Desktop folder of the root and got the flag:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (149) (1).png>)

## Lessons Learned

This is one of my first 5 Windows machines that I have learned to work on. I did learn a lot about, such as making sure to looking for hidden folders to how to spot flags using BurpSuite. It was a great box. It took me about 3 hours to complete. A lot of that had to do with my lack of knowledge in Windows exploitation. In addition, enumerating for me took a while, since some searches were taking a long time so I had to go find an alternative.
