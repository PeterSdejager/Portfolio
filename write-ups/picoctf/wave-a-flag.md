# Wave a flag

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (66).png>)

I ran **file** on the file and I got this result:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (76).png>)

This made me realize that it is an executable binary file. I changed the file to an executable using **chmod +x \<file>**. I then ran the file and got the file:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (63) (1).png>)
