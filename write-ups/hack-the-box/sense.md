There are two ports open, on port 80, we see the following:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (487).png>)

It seems that pfSense is running on the system. I tried the default credentials of **admin**:**pfsense**, but that did not work out. I ran a **dirsearch** command (`dirsearch -u https://10.10.10.60/`) to see what I was able to get access to and found this:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (446).png>)

There still seems to be one vulnerability in place. I ran different searches in the directory to try to find something else, but came up short. When I viewed the official write-up to see what I missed, apparently running the lowercase medium word-list in **dirbusters** word-list directory would have shown me an IP\_Address/system-users.txt file:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (646) (1).png>)

The company defaults for pfSense was **pfsense**. The credentials **rohit**:**pfsense** got me into the system:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (650).png>)

Searching for "pfsense" on **metasploit** showed me a couple of results for exploits. I chose one and then fixed the options to work for this box:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (376).png>)

I then had a reverse shell:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (525).png>)

I was then able to find the user.txt flag in **rohit**'s home directory:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (616).png>)

I was then able to get the root flag as well:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (424) (1).png>)
